# Farmer Buddy 
## Introduction
Farmer Buddy is an application-based project developed during my second year. This project is designed to be a valuable resource for farmers and agricultural students, focusing on the benefits of organic farming. With a growing awareness of environmental sustainability, this application promotes the use of organic fertilizers, which are safer for the environment and contribute to healthier crops.
